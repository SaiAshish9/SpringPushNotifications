Power of web push notifications is that it allows people to know that something special has happened even
if their web app is not opened.

we need a browser that supports them, that can be chrome, firefox or edge.

we also need a server for that we use java webpush library.

we would also need a notifications api that actually shows the notification and serviceworker.

Serviceworket is between the js and the network.

Commonly it's used for catching so that application can work fast even if the user is offline.

It can also be used for receiving push notifications
