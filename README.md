Power of web push notifications is that it allows people to know that 
something special has happened even
if their web app is not opened.

we need a browser that supports them, that can be chrome, firefox or edge.

we also need a server for that we use java webpush library.

we would also need a notifications api that actually shows the notification 
and serviceworker.

Serviceworket is between the js and the network.

Commonly it's used for catching so that application can work fast even 
if the user is offline.

It can also be used for receiving push notifications
